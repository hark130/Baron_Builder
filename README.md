A save game editor for (Pathfinder Kingmaker)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder:_Kingmaker] by (Owlcat Games)[https://owlcatgames.com/] that is written in Python 3 and supports Linux, Windows, and Apple installations.

## Description

I like the game Pathfinder Kingmaker but it has a lot of bugs, issues, and oversights.  Game-ending events happen without much fanfare, save games are deleted, plot-completing item drops are lost, etc.  Hours are being lost in what is becoming a poorly documented and unforgiving experience.  I want to continue but I don't want to waste my time on multiple restarts just to hit the same mysterious roadblock.  So here we are...

## Purpose

My end goal is to create a save game editor that works on all operating systems supported by (Pathfinder Kingmaker)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder:_Kingmaker].  I want this save game editor to resolve many of the issues my friends and I have been encountering.  I won't support _everything_ but I will support fixes to the annoying, poorly documented, game-ending problems that have been cropping up during our playthroughs.
